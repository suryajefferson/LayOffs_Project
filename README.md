## Abstract

This project analyzes global job layoffs using a comprehensive dataset encompassing various companies, industries, and time periods. The primary objective was to uncover trends and patterns in layoffs, including the impact on different sectors, companies, and temporal fluctuations. Through SQL queries and data aggregation, the analysis reveals key insights into which companies and industries were most affected, the relationship between funding and layoffs, and the trends over time. This project highlights the importance of data cleaning and optimization in SQL for accurate and meaningful analysis, providing a detailed view of the dynamics of job layoffs across the global job market.
# About the Data

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on global job layoffs across various companies and industries. Key attributes include:

- **Company**: The name of the company where layoffs occurred.
- **Location**: The geographical location of the company.
- **Industry**: The industry sector to which the company belongs.
- **Total Laid Off**: The number of employees laid off by the company.
- **Percentage Laid Off**: The percentage of the companyâ€™s workforce that was laid off.
- **Date**: The date when the layoffs were announced or took place.
- **Stage**: The business stage of the company (e.g., Post-IPO, Series B, etc.).
- **Country**: The country where the company is headquartered.
- **Funds Raised**: The amount of funds (in millions) raised by the company.

This data provides a comprehensive overview of layoffs across different sectors, regions, and time periods, allowing for in-depth analysis of trends and patterns in job cuts.

# Tools I Used

For my detailed study of the data analyst job market, I used several important tools:

- **SQL**: The main tool for querying the database and finding key insights.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database system I used to manage the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred tool for managing the database and running SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Crucial for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, enabling collaboration and tracking.

# Overview of this Project

### Phase 1: Database Setup

1. **Creating the Database** - Establish a new database, ensuring it is structured according to the requirements of the project.

2. **Creating the Tables** - Design and implement the tables within the database, defining appropriate schema and data types to store the data effectively.

3. **Loading the Data** - Import the data into the created tables, ensuring it is correctly mapped and integrated for analysis.


### Phase 2: Data Cleaning

1. **Copying Original Table** - It is recommended to apply changes to a copied version of the table rather than modifying the original.

2. **Removing Duplicates** - Eliminate repetitive rows to ensure data accuracy.

3. **Standardizing Data** - Identify and correct issues such as spelling errors, column type mismatches, and other discrepancies.

4. **Handling NULL values and Blank values** - Decide whether to delete, fill, or leave blank/null values as they are.

5. **Removing Unnecessary Rows and Columns** - Remove any rows or columns that are not needed.


### Phase 3: EDA

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is the process of examining and summarizing a dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and insights before applying more complex analyses.

<summary><h1><strong>Phase 1: Database Setup</strong></h1></summary>


### 1. Creating the Database

``` sql 
CREATE DATABASE World_Layoffs;
```

### 2. Creating the Table

``` sql 
-- Create layoffs table 
CREATE TABLE public.layoffs_original
(
    company TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    industry TEXT,
    total_laid_off INT,
    percentage_laid_off NUMERIC,
    date TEXT,
    stage TEXT,
    country TEXT,
    funds_raised_millions NUMERIC
);


-- Set ownership of the tables to the postgres user
ALTER TABLE public.layoffs_original OWNER to postgres;
```

### 3. Loading the Data


- In PostgresSQL > PgAdmin4 > PSQL Tool, using these commands to insert data from csv files to database
``` sql 
\copy layoffs FROM 'D:\SQL\LayOffs\Files\layoffs.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8', NULL 'NULL');
```


</details>

<br><br><br>
<details>
<summary><h1><strong>Phase 2: Data Cleaning</strong></h1></summary>


### 1. Copying the Original Table
- It is advisable to make changes to a copy of the table rather than the original


``` sql 
CREATE TABLE layoffs(
    LIKE layoffs_raw);


INSERT INTO layoffs(
    SELECT * FROM layoffs_raw);
```


### 2. Removing Duplicates

**Identifying Duplicates** 
- First, identify duplicates by assigning a row number to each row based on key columns

``` sql
SELECT * ,
ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY company,location,industry,total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,date,stage, country, funds_raised_millions ) as ROW_NUM
FROM layoffs;
```

**Removing Duplicates Method 1**
- Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to remove duplicates



``` sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT ctid,company,row_num
    FROM (
        SELECT ctid,company,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) AS row_num
        FROM layoffs
    ) AS duplicate
    WHERE row_num > 1
)
DELETE 
FROM layoffs
WHERE ctid IN (SELECT ctid FROM cte);
```



<details>
<summary><strong>Removing Duplicates Method 2</strong></summary>

- Alternatively, create a new table with row_number as added column

``` sql 
ALTER TABLE layoffs ADD row_num INT;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs;

CREATE TABLE layoffs2 (
company text,
location text,
industry text,
total_laid_off INT,
percentage_laid_off text,
date text,
stage text,
country text,
funds_raised_millions int,
row_num INT
);

INSERT INTO layoffs2
(company,
location,
industry,
total_laid_off,
percentage_laid_off,
date,
stage,
country,
funds_raised_millions,
row_num)
SELECT company,
location,
industry,
total_laid_off,
percentage_laid_off,
date,
stage,
country,
funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off, date, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs;
        
```

- Remove rows where row_num is greater than 1

```sql 
DELETE FROM layoffs2
WHERE row_num >= 1;
```




-  Check  for successful deletion of duplicates

``` sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT * ,
    ROW_NUMBER () OVER (PARTITION BY company,location,industry,total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,date,stage, country, funds_raised_millions ) as ROW_NUM
    FROM layoffs) AS duplicate
WHERE row_num > 1;
```

- Empty results must appear

###  3. Standardizing Data

After a thorough review of the data column by column, it was determined that data cleaning is necessary for some columns

1. **Industry Column**
   - **Problem 1:** NULL values and potential blanks
   - *solution* : Fill those NULL values and blanks
   - **Problem 2:** Variations in "Crypto" entries
   - *solution* : Change values that start with 'Crypto' to 'Crypto'


2. **Country Column**
   - **Problem 1:** Variations like "United States" and "United States." (with a period)
   - *solution* : Remove '.'

3. **Percentage_laid_off Column**
   - **Problem 1:** Values are stored as strings.
   - *solution* : Convert values and column type to NUMERIC

4. **Date Column**
   - **Problem 1:** Dates are stored as strings.
   - *solution* : Convert values and column type to DATE format

**1. Cleaning the `industry` Column**

*Problem 1:* NULL values and potential Blanks

*solution* : Fill those NULL values and Blanks

- Take a look at the  distinct industries
``` sql 
SELECT DISTINCT(industry)
FROM layoffs
ORDER BY 1;
```

###### The Airbnb entry is intended for travel but lacks population.
###### Similar issues are likely with other entries.
###### Write a query to update duplicates with non-null industry values.
###### This approach will handle large datasets efficiently without manual checks.
- Set the Blanks to NULLS, as they are easier to work with

``` sql 
UPDATE layoffs
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';
```
``` sql

###### As these rows of data are unnecessary for the analysis. Hence, remove them
- Remove rows where both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off are null

``` sql
DELETE FROM layoffs
WHERE   total_laid_off IS Null AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
```
- Run the code again to see for the successfull deletion

``` sql
SELECT *
FROM layoffs
WHERE   total_laid_off IS Null AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;
```
###### Empty results should appear
- Remove the row_num column that was previously created

``` sql
ALTER TABLE layoffs
DROP COLUMN row_num;
```
#### Data Ready for EDA


``` sql
SELECT *
FROM layoffs
ORDER BY RANDOM ()
LIMIT 5;

**Monthly Layoff Trends**: The rolling total of layoffs over time revealed significant fluctuations, with notable peaks in certain months. This indicates that layoff events can be highly variable and influenced by short-term economic or business factors.


</details>

### 10. Rolling Total of Layoffs by Month

Explanation:

- Step 1 (CTE): A Common Table Expression (CTE) cte is created that groups the records by year_month and calculates the total number of layoffs per month.

- Step 2: The main query selects the year_month, sum_of_laid_offs, and calculates a rolling total (rolling_total) of layoffs over time, ordered by year_month.
``` sql

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
        SUM(total_laid_off) AS sum_of_laid_offs
    FROM layoffs
    WHERE to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM') IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY year_month
    ORDER BY 1 
)

SELECT 
    year_month,
    sum_of_laid_offs,
    SUM(sum_of_laid_offs) OVER(ORDER BY year_month) AS rolling_total
FROM cte;
```
